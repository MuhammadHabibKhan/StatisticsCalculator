# StatisticsCalculator
1st Semester Project for Course Introduction to Computer Science - I. I had made all these functions first in Matlab for Probability &amp; Statistics - I Course. Then I had the idea to write them again in Python and make a GUI application of it. I went with Tkinter as it was the easiet and quickest learn. My knowledge was limited at the time which resulted in an unorganized code but I learned a lot from this project. I'm currently studying OOP so I plan to make this application again using the concepts of object oriented programming, will update ;)
